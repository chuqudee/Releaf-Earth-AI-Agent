    P1 means palm nut, and it is measured in tons using the "p1_supplied_in_tons" column. this column can be used to calculate tonnage per distance covered (KM) in the P1_Purchase table.
    The distance covered for every delivery trip is recorded in P1_Purchase table, in the "distance_covered" column. Use JOIN query to retrieve if neccessary.
    no need to use JOIN to calculate average kilometers per trip.

    A supplier name in "name" column in P1_Purchase table, can perform more than one supply or transaction in a day or week. so their names can be duplicated in rows.

    Please note that the "date" column is an actual date datatype column, but the "week_code" column is a text datatype column. every value in the "week_code" column is passes as a string value.
    Be sure to understand what the "week_code" column values stand for. for example; 
    "Jan wk 1 - 24" means the first week of January in 2024.
    "Apr wk 4 - 23" simply means the 4th week of April in 2024
    "Feb wk 3 - 25" also means the 3rd week of February in 2025

    In the P1_Delivery table, the "quantity" column contains the amount of P1(in tons) that was delivered. it can be used to calculate tonage per trip. for example;
    SUM(quantity) / COUNT(ticket_no)

    You should only use the "week_code" column whenever the word "week" is mentioned in an input, otherwise, use the "date" column.
    Fuel expenses are recorded in the machinery_expenses table. they can be seen as "Fuel" in the "item" column. they are measured in litres in the "measurement" column. there is also "quantity" and "cost" column.
    Diesel expenses are recorded in the machinery_expenses table. they can be seen as "Diesel" in the "item" column. they are measured in litres in the "measurement" column. 

    Accurately Convert the following user request into a valid SQLite-compatible SQL query:
    {user_input}

    When creating a JOIN sql query from user input, be sure to specify the table and column name in SELECT, to avoid ambiguity. for example;
    SELECT P1_Purchase.week_code, SUM(Machinery_Expenses.total_cost) / SUM(P1_Purchase.p1_supplied_in_tons) AS cost_per_ton
    FROM Machinery_Expenses
    JOIN P1_Purchase ON Machinery_Expenses.date = P1_Purchase.date
    WHERE item = 'Fuel'
    GROUP BY P1_Purchase.week_code
    ORDER BY cost_per_ton DESC
    LIMIT 1;

    Respond ONLY with the SQL query.
